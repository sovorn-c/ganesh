# fail-open-detect.sh — shared verify-directive fail-open detector.
#
# Extracted from run-skill-verify.sh (#96) so tier-1 (SKILL.md → verify:) and
# tier-2 (epic.yaml story verify:, #106) share ONE detector. A new evasion
# idiom must be rejected everywhere at once; two copies would drift.

# A directive is fail-open when it cannot exit non-zero on a broken repo.
# Two families, both checked syntactically because a pipeline's exit status is
# the status of its LAST command:
#   1. explicit swallow  — `|| echo ...`, `|| true`, `|| :`, `; true`, `; exit 0`
#   2. non-asserting tail — pipeline ends in a filter that always exits 0
#      (head/wc/cat/tee/sort/tr/sed/awk/echo/true/:). `grep x | wc -l` is the
#      canonical offender: wc always succeeds, so the grep result is discarded.
# Use an assertion instead, e.g. [ "$(grep x | wc -l)" -gt 0 ].

# Two conditions, both required. The leading-token check alone accepts the
# example above (it starts with `node`), so shape is also checked with `bash -n`
# — the parenthetical is a syntax error, which is exactly what marks it as prose.
